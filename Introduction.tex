motivation: aesthetic: Coleman-Mandula --> Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius-Theorem\\
plots for exclusion of squarks in specific SUSY scenarios (from Michael) --> R-Symmetry could be possible explanation for that because:\\
MSSM-Lagrangian --> trafo rules for superfields under R-symm --> forbidden terms in MRSSM (write down Lagrangian for R-symmetric SUSYQCD)\\
suppression of squark production in MRSSM by less diagrams ($m_{gluino}^{-4}$ suppression at low energies in MRSSM and only $m_{gluino}^{-2}$ suppression in MSSM)\\
R-charges of all fields (show in diagram!) --> only if R-charges of final / initial particles are zero, a diagram is allowed in R-symm. model\\
